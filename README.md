# Certobot-Manager

Certobot-Manager is a Python-based tool for renewing SSL/TLS certificates generated by Certbot for multiple domains.

## Requirements

Certobot-Manager is a tool to check if the domains listed in a certbot-generated SSL/TLS certificate meet the necessary requirements to renew the certificate. The tool uses the Apache plugin of Certbot for testing purposes.

The tool consists of a Makefile that executes various Python scripts through different rules.

* Python 3.6 or higher
* Apache with the Certbot plugin installed
* Certbot-generated SSL/TLS certificate with multiple domains
* GNU Make

You can install Python and Certbot using your operating system's package manager or by downloading them from their respective websites. Make are typically pre-installed on most Unix-based systems.
